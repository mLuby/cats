Using React/Redux:

1) Get cat images from "http://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=xml&results_per_page=25"
2) Get cat facts from "http://catfacts-api.appspot.com/api/facts?number=25"
3) Append the results to DOM.
  - One image will have one fact associated with it.
4) Be able to remove/delete images (with attached fact) from DOM.
