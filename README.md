# Cats Challenge

### Instructions
Using Angular, React, or Vue:
- Get cat images from http://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=xml&results_per_page=25.
- Get cat facts from http://cors-proxy.htmldriven.com/?url=https://catfact.ninja/facts?limit=25.
- Append the results to DOM for the user to view, associating each image with one fact.
- Give the user a way to remove an image (with attached fact) from the DOM.

### What we're looking for
- functional: `git clone <your solution>` `npm install` `npm start` should let us see cats.
- readability: we'll be reviewing your code as we would a PR, so make it understandable.
- extensibility: we may ask you to add various features, so make it easy to do so.
